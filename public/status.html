Your insurance coverage is subject to the terms set out in this document. Who is eligible for coverage? To be eligible for insurance coverage you must: • be a Canadian resident (applicable to Emergency Medical Insurance coverage); • be under 60 years of age and travel for less than 183 days; • be 60 years of age or older and under 75 years of age and travel for less than 60 days; • purchase coverage through a Canadian representative appointed by RBC Insurance Company of Canada; • purchase coverage for the full duration of your trip; • have correctly completed the medical questionnaire if the non-refundable portion exceeds $15,000; • be covered under your government health insurance plan for the full duration of your trip. This insurance is subject to a maximum of $20,000 if you do not have valid government health insurance plan coverage at the time of claim. How do you become insured? You become insured and this policy becomes an insurance contract: • when you are named on your completed insurance application/confirmationof coverage; • upon payment of the required premium on or before your effective date; and • upon completion of the medical questionnaire, where applicable. In addition, an infant travelling with an immediate family member covered under Deluxe Package, is insured under the terms of our Emergency Medical Insurance, and we will not charge a premium for the infant’s coverage. When does your insurance start and end? Insurance starts on your effective date. Insurance ends on the earliest of: a) the date of the cause of cancellation if your trip is cancelled before your date of departure from your departure point; b) the date you return to your province, territory or country of residence; c) midnight of your return date; d) midnight of your expiry date; e) 183 days after your date of departure from your departure point; f) 365 days after your date of departure from your departure point under Flight Accident. When does your coverage automatically extend? 1 If you cannot complete your trip by your return date because of the delay of a common carrier in which you are scheduled to travel, your coverage will automatically extend for the delay period to a maximum of 72 hours. 2 If you or your travelling companion are hospitalized on your return date or expiry date, your coverage will automatically extend for the period of hospitalization and up to an additional 5 days after discharge (not available for Cancellation & Interruption). 3 If you or your travelling companion are delayed beyond your return date because of a medical condition and are medically unable to travel, but are not hospitalized, your coverage will automatically extend for the delay period to a maximum of 5 days after your return date (not available for Cancellation & Interruption). 4 Regardless of the automatic extensions above, coverage will not continue beyond 365 days from your latest date of departure from your departure point. What if you decide to extend your trip? If you decide to extend your trip, any extension of your coverage is subject to the following conditions: 1 a) If you have not had a medical condition under your existing coverage under any of our insurances, you must request the extension by contacting your Canadian representative before your return date. b) If you have had a medical condition under your existing coverage under any of our insurances, you must request the extension by contacting Assured Assistance Inc. before your return date, and the extension is subject to the approval of Assured Assistance Inc. 2 You must pay the required additional premium before your original return date. 3 If the insurance for which you require the extension is not available for the duration that includes the total number of days of your trip and any optional extension(s), your coverage cannot be extended. Instead, you may be able to purchase a new policy under the coverage: a) for which you are eligible; and 6 RBC Insurance Deluxe Single Trip V_13.1_July2016 b) that is available for the duration that includes the period beginning with your effective date and ending at your new return date. The terms, conditions and exclusions of the extension policy apply to you during the extension period. What if you want to top-up another insurer’s travel insurance? If you are covered under another insurer’s travel insurance, you may purchase top-up coverage from your Canadian representative only before your date of departure from your departure point, and: a) You must pay the required top-up premium before your date of departure from your departure point. b) If the entire duration of your intended travel period is greater than 183 days (including the period of time in which you are covered under another insurer’s travel insurance), you wish to purchase top-up coverage with one of our emergency medical coverages, and you are 60 years of age or older, you must complete the medical questionnaire. c) The terms, conditions and exclusions of our policy issued as top-up apply to you. d) You cannot purchase an annual coverage to top-up a single trip (if you have travel insurance included with your credit card coverage, you can purchase an annual coverage as top-up). When can your premium be refunded? 1 All requests for premium refunds must be submitted to the Canadian representative from whom you purchased the insurance. 2 No refund of premium will be made in the event that a claim has been paid, incurred or reported or if you have already departed on your trip. 3 The premium you paid can be refunded only if your trip is cancelled before you depart on your trip and: • the supplier (tour operator, airline, etc.) cancels your trip and all penalties are waived; or • the supplier (tour operator, airline, etc.) changes the travel dates and you are unable to travel on these dates and all penalties are waived; or • you cancel your trip before any cancellation penalties are in effect. Terrorism Coverage Where an act of terrorism directly or indirectly causes a loss that would otherwise be payable under one of the covered risks in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy, this insurance will provide coverage as follows: a) Terrorism Coverage is not available under Flight and Travel Accident Insurance. b) We will, for Cancellation & Interruption claims, except in the case of catastrophic event, reimburse you up to a maximum of 100% of your eligible loss. c) We will, for Cancellation & Interruption claims resulting in a catastrophic event, and subject to the limits described in paragraph f), reimburse you up to a maximum of 50% of your eligible loss. d) For all other classes of insurance, we will reimburse you up to a maximum of 100% of your eligible loss. e) The benefits payable in accordance with paragraphs b), c) and d) are in excess to all other potential sources of recovery, including but not limited to, alternative or replacement travel options offered by airlines, tour operators, cruise lines and other travel suppliers and other insurance coverage (even where such other coverage is described as excess) and will only respond after you have exhausted all such other sources. f) The benefits payable in accordance with paragraph c) shall be paid out of a fund and, where total claims exceed fund limits, eligible claims shall be reduced on a pro rata basis so that the maximum payment out of the fund for all policyholders shall be CDN$5,000,000 per act of terrorism or series of acts of terrorism occurring within a 72-hour period. The total maximum payment out of the fund for all policyholders shall be CDN$10,000,000 per calendar year regardless of the number of acts of terrorism. If, in our judgment, the total of all payable claims for all policyholders under one or more acts of terrorism may exceed the applicable fund maximum limits, your prorated claim will be paid after the end of the calendar year. Emergency MedicalInsurance What must you do in a medical emergency? You must contact Assured Assistance Inc. before seeking emergency treatment. In addition, all surgery and heart procedures, including heart catheterization, must be approved in advance by the medical advisors of Assured Assistance Inc. When you contact Assured Assistance Inc., they will refer you or may transfer you, when medically appropriate, to one of the accredited medical service providers within the network. Assured Assistance Inc. will also request for the medical service provider within the network to bill the medical expenses covered under this insurance directly to us instead of to you. Failure to call may result in reduced benefits. Emergency Contact Numbers: • 1-800-387-2487 (toll-free call from USA or Canada) • 905-816-2561 (collect call from anywhere through a local operator) • 1-888-298-6340 (toll-free fax from the USA or Canada) • 905-813-4719 (fax) What coverage limitations apply? 1 If you do not contact Assured Assistance Inc. at the time of your medical emergency or you choose to receive treatment from a medical service provider outside the network, you will be responsible for 30% of your medical expenses covered under this insurance and in excess of your medical expenses paid by your government health insurance plan. If your medical condition prevents you from calling Assured Assistance Inc. before seeking emergency treatment, you must call Assured Assistance Inc. as soon as medically possible. As an alternative, someone else (family member, friend, hospital or physician’s office staff, etc.) may call on your behalf. 2 This insurance does not cover expenses incurred within your home province or territory of residence. 3 This insurance is subjectto a maximum of $20,000 if you do not have valid government health insurance plan coverage at the time of claim. What risks are insured? This insurance covers the reasonable and customary medical expenses you actually incur once you have left your departure point for necessary medical care or surgery, as part of the emergency treatment arising from a medical condition. This insurance only covers expenses in excess of those covered under your government health insurance plan and by any other insurance or benefit plan under which you are covered.
